                <p>The Spearhead Squadron is a squadron formed of elite Processors.
              They are stationed on the eastern front, the side closest to the border of the former Empire and thus closest to the Legion.</p>
              
              <p>The Republic of San Magnolia promises the colorata that are forcefully conscripted will be granted "Honorary Alba" status afet completing 5 years of service effectively retunring their human rights.
              Howerver as November of 2148 would tell us, those that are nearing their 5 year service mark are formed into The Spearhead Squadron under the gise of being an "elite unit."
              </p>
              The Spearhead Squadron is mearly an execution grounds to allow thr Republic from honouring the 5 year service rule as the squad is placed in the most dangerous front.
              Once the numbers have thinned enough the squad is sent on a "long range recon expedition" deep into legion territory.
              <p>
              The five that were found by pure chance on November of 2148 are the only recorded instance of the mission having more than a 0% survival rate.
              In other words, not a single 86 was given the title of "Honourary Alba" and their human rights reinstated.

                      The Republic of San Magnolia is divided into 85 distict districts with the most important district of 1 being in the centre and the numbers increasing the further you go from the centre.
                      
                      The 86th district is an unofficial term given to the area out side the gran mur, a wall built by forced labour from the Colorata, that surrounds the 85 official districts.
                      Colorata, as they are not considered humans under republic law, are not permitted to live within the official 85 districts.
                      These "86" as the Alba within the walls like to refer to them as, are not allowed to procreate and instead are forced to conscript into the army as "Processors."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Those that are too young to work or fight in the army, such as infants or toddlers, are rumored to be sold to Alban nobility. Only god knows what they were sold for and I beleive it should stay that way.
                      There are also rumor that some Colorata were used as test subjects for the Para-Raid system that allows two users to share their senses. However very little documentation on how the Para-Raid system is available to us

                    <p>The drones piloted by the Colorata were known as "Jugguernaughts." However more fitting ly they were also called walking coffins. As there no "human" casualties the colorata were fobidden from making any grave amrker in an attempt to hide the attrocities commited by The Republic.
                       The only names recorded were those kept in secret, such as the 576 juggernaught fragments those from TheSPearhead Squadron carried with them.</p>
                    <p>The Republic lazed away as they all completely ignored the warnings that the few Colorata cared enough to give the the legion's two year expiry date was no longer in effect.</p>

                       <h3>Nordlicht Squadron Spears Morpho</h3>
                    <p>On October 11th 2149, Shinei Nouzen, formerly known as Undertaker and priviously the captain of The Spearhead Squadron, has destroyed the High powered Rail gun model of Legion known as the Morpho.
                      The Morpho model single handedly destroyed the major fortifications that The Republic of San Magnolia also known as the Gran Mur. The destruction of the Gran Mur lead to the near extiction of San Magnolia before the Federacy of Giad responded with humanitarian efforts.
                      With the Morpho causing the near extiction of the 86's former oppressors it's almost poetic that a former 86 would be the one to take it down.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Spearheads Once Again</h3>
                    <p>
                      It is just announced that the five survivors of the Spearhead Squadron, Shinei nouzen, Anju Emma, Raiden Shuga, Kurena Kukumila, and Theoto Rikka, will be returning to the battle field for a second time.
                      On January 7th of 2149 the five will be enrolled in The Special Officers Academy to be officially indoctrinated into the Fedreacy of Giad's Army.
                      The general public would be more than forgiving if they induldged in the peace that they were refused withing The Republic.
                      These actions certainly beg the question. Why return to the hell they came from? Is it the only life they think they can lead? Do they have unfinished buisness with the Legion?
                      Ultimately the reasons are for them alone and if it's good enough to return to the battle field who are we to stop them?
                      The only thing we can do for them is pray for their safe return.
